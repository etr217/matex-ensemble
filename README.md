## Setup
Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/learningmatter-mit/matex.git
```
Create and activate a virtual environment
```
conda create -n blt-matex python=3.9.16
conda activate blt-matex
```
Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Environment Setup
Update hyperparameters in `blt/configs/materials.yml`.
Run the following command where `path_to_dir` is the parent directory of `matex`.
```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:path_to_dir"
```


## Data
Run the following script to process the data. Raw data is provided in `blt/data`. Processed data will be saved under `blt/data` as `pkl` files.
```
bash data_modules/create_data.sh
```


## Training and Evaluation
Run the following script to train, evaluate and save the model
```
cd blt
bash train_eval.sh
```

Run the following script to create and save distribution and correlation plots
```
python plot_maker/plots.py
```
